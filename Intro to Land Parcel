Land parcel databases, which are also known as cadastres, describe the rights, interests, and value of property. 
The legal boundaries of land parcels are defined in the deed to a property. 

A surveyor confirms these measurements anytime the property is subdivided or platted, or in boundary disputes. 

These maps are often used as the parcel maps for a jurisdiction. The aggregate set of land parcels represents the distribution of the real
property assets of a community and its ownership, forms the basis for all land use and zoning decisions, 
and represents the location of residences, businesses, and public lands
